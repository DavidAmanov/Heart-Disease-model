# Heart-Disease-model
Hi! Here is my graduation work from online courses on learning the Python language. 
In it, I tried to build several models that could predict possible health problems, I hope I succeeded. 
Unfortunately, I don't speak English well at the moment and therefore everything inside the files is described in Russian, but I think the translator will help you. Thanks!
